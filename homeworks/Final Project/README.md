My final project for the robotics course is a smart traffic light system.
How it works is this: without any interference, one traffic light is green and the other one red for 15seconds, then the yellow light replaces the green for 2seconds, then both traffic lights stay red for 2seconds and the process repeates (but on the opposite side).
Of course, these are not real life values, but I chose them this way to show more easily the principles.
I have chosen the maximum of 15seconds so that the traffic lights keep changing even if no car is passing through the intersection.

If, on one lane, the green light has been on for at least 5 seconds and from the opposite lane the sensor detects a car approaching, the traffic lights will change colors in order to make the car flow more efficient.
