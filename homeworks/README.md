The first homework was to create a circuit in which we could control the intensity of the colours inside the RGB LED
using a potentiometer for each of them.


The second homework was to create a circuit where a passive piezo buzzer would detect a knock louder than a given intensity. After 5 seconds, the active piezo buzzer would start making a sound. Using a button, we would be able to stop the active buzzer or restart it, but only after those 5 seconds passed.
