The first homework was to create a circuit in which we could control the intensity of the colours inside the RGB LED
using a potentiometer for each of them.


The second homework was to create a circuit where a passive piezo buzzer would detect a knock louder than a given intensity. After 5 seconds, the active piezo buzzer would start making a sound. Using a button, we would be able to stop the active buzzer or restart it, but only after those 5 seconds passed.


The third homework was to create a circuit in which the number displayed by the 4 digit 7 segment LED display could be controlled by a joystick. With the X axes, we could go through the digits, with the switch we could select a digit to be edited and with the Y axes we could increase or decrease that digit. The switch should be pressed again in order to go through the digits again. The decimal point is used as a position mark.


Homework nr 4 was to create a game menu that consisted of a "Play" option, a "Highscore" option and a "Setting option". Scrolling through
them would be done using a ">" as a pointer. Each of them can be entered by pressing the button on the joystick. Inside the actual game,
you start at the level 0, which increases every 2seconds. The score is 3 times bigger than the level. You have 3 lives, which you can lose
by pressing the joystick button. You can either win after 20seconds or lose by pressing the button 3 times. No matter if you win or lose,
there is a message that appeares for 3 seconds and, afterwards, you return to the menu. If you select highscore, you can view, obviously,
the highest score. You can only exit this menu option by clicking the joystick. The axes don't do anything. If you select settings, you can
increase or decrease (but it can't go lower than 0) the starting level of the game using the horizontal axes. You also exit through the
joystick button.
