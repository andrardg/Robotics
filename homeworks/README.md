The first homework was to create a circuit in which we could control the intensity of the colours inside the RGB LED
using a potentiometer for each of them.


The second homework was to create a circuit where a passive piezo buzzer would detect a knock louder than a given intensity. After 5 seconds, the active piezo buzzer would start making a sound. Using a button, we would be able to stop the active buzzer or restart it, but only after those 5 seconds passed.


The third homework was to create a circuit in which the number displayed by the 4 digit 7 segment LED display could be controlled by a joystick. With the X axes, we could go through the digits, with the switch we could select a digit to be edited and with the Y axes we could increase or decrease that digit. The switch should be pressed again in order to go through the digits again. The decimal point is used as a position mark.
