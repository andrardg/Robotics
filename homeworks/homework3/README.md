The third homework was to create a circuit in which the number displayed by the 4 digit 7 segment LED display could be controlled by a joystick. With the X axes, we could go through the digits, with the switch we could select a digit to be edited and with the Y axes we could increase or decrease that digit. The switch should be pressed again in order to go through the digits again. The decimal point is used as a position mark.
