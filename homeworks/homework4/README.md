Homework nr 4 was to create a game menu that consisted of a "Play" option, a "Highscore" option and a "Setting option". Scrolling through them would be done using a ">" as a pointer. Each of them can be entered by pressing the button on the joystick. Inside the actual game, you start at the level 0, which increases every 2seconds. The score is 3 times bigger than the level. You have 3 lives, which you can lose by pressing the joystick button. You can either win after 20seconds or lose by pressing the button 3 times. No matter if you win or lose, there is a message that appeares for 3 seconds and, afterwards, you return to the menu. If you select highscore, you can view, obviously, the highest score. You can only exit this menu option by clicking the joystick. The axes don't do anything. If you select settings, you can increase or decrease (but it can't go lower than 0) the starting level of the game using the horizontal axes. You also exit through the joystick button.
